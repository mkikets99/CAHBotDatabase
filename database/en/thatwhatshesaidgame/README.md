| can you keep it down, I'm working here! |
| come into my rose garden |
| did we both finish at the same time? |
| did you remember to bring the wet wipes? |
| do you just want to do it yourself? |
| don't look down, look up |
| every girl oves a little rabbit |
| here comes the money shot |
| I always come the right away |
| I can feel a rush coming on |
| I can't seem to put my finger on it |
| I did all the work, you clean up the mess |
| I have experience on both ends |
| I just need a little milk for my Fruit Loops |
| I like to mix business with pleasure |
| I'd bend over backwards for you |
| I'd do almost anything for a hundred bucks |
| I'm blessed in more ways than one |
| I'm craving muffin tops |
| I'm going to go a lot deeper than you think |
| I'm gonna need the cash up front |
| I'm headed down south |
| I'm just yanking your chain |
| I'm kind of a slow learner |
| I'm looking for a lot of seamen |
| I've updated my terms and conditions |
| if you swallow what's in your mouth, I'll give you more |
| if you're sitting in the first three rows, prepare to get soaked |
| in the face!!! |
| it's a dirty job and I love to do it |
| it's always good to have a plan B |
| it's like breaking in a catcher's mitt |
| it's time to plug it and chug it |
| keep the back door shut |
| let me toss your salad |
| let's go slow, it feels like we're gonna get caught |
| let's meet at the Bush n' Tush |
| let's take a look under the hood |
| look at the size of that crack! |
| my mama told me not to ride with strangers |
| my package came today |
| no more coke |
| nobody rides for free |
| not a drop spilled |
| not everything has to be a competition |
| please double bag |
| really? you've never been inside? |
| rwo in the cake, one in the pudding |
| sometimes boys just have to be with other boys |
| the darker the berry, the sweeter the juice |
| the goal is to escape |
| they look like a couple of fried eggs hanging from a nail |
| they're starting to sag |
| this one's exit only |
| wait till you see my new toys |
| winter is coming |
| would you like a saddle or do you want to ride bareback? |
| you can't eat what you can't catch |
| you can't just wash slime away with a shower |
| you need a haircut, and I'm not talking about your head |
| you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours |
| you'll be walking funny tomorrow |
| you're looking a little stiff |
| you're my least favorite cousin |
| you're quite the nutter |
